**Vigil Reporter for Rust. Used in pair with Vigil, the Microservices Status Page.**

Vigil Reporter is used to actively submit health information to Vigil from your apps. Apps are best monitored via application probes, which are able to report detailed system information such as CPU and RAM load. This lets Vigil show if an application host system is under high load.

**🚨 Vigil Reporter is currently Work In Progress (WIP). Stable version is coming soon (2 months ETA).**
